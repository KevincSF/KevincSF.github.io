          <p class="abstract">This study explores the negativity bias in user engagement with YouTube news and the effectiveness of negative sentiment in attracting attention.

The paper explore whether political news attracts a higher quantity of negative sentiment comments and the differences in likes distributed to negative sentiment comments in political and non-political news, and revealing a stronger negativity bias in user comment in political news, but also showing that relative less likes are distributed to negative comments in political news. This paper is based on analyzing comments and likes from BBC Breaking News videos.</p>
